**Backend using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Hibernate. Hosted on AWS utilizing EC2, S3, RDS. Frontend using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS.**

**This project helps me sharpen my skill as a developer. I learn how to develop a backend system, create REST APIs with the Java Spring Boot framework, and integrate PostgreSQL. I also explored more about the AWS cloud platform and its services, such as EC2, RDS, and S3. I added front-end UI using jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to complete this project.**
