This project helps me sharpen my skill as a developer. I learn how to build a backend system with the Java Spring Boot framework and integrate PostgreSQL. I also explored more about the AWS cloud platform and its services, such as EC2, RDS, and S3. I added front-end UI using jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to complete this project.
